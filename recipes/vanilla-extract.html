    <p><h2>This is a frugal recipe to make vanilla extract from scratch</h2></p>
    
    <p>Now before you start sending me dozens of emails and 
        comments, I realize that some will not consider an 
        extract make without alcohol a “true extract”. 
        Whatever you believe on this, the following recipe 
        will perform exactly the same as an extract made with 
        alcohol. If you prefer to make your recipe with alcohol,
        more power to ya, that's just not what this blog post 
        is about.
    </p>
    <p>With that aside, let's jump right into this. It's so easy!</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vanilla Beans</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
